This works also on the iPhone when you set it up with List selections, but really shines for the mac and the iPad. \nNavigationSplitView allows for further custom styling with navigationSplitViewStyle for prominentDetail and balanced. You can also set the column width and show\/hide columns programmatically. \nNavigationSplitView came with SwiftUI 4 during WWDC 2022.",

    "intro" : "In Swift, a KeyPath is a way to reference a property, or a nested set of properties, of a particular type in a type-safe manner. It provides a convenient and type-checked way to access properties and their values without needing to use string-based key-value coding (KVC) or dynamic member lookup. KeyPaths are often used in Swift for tasks like sorting, filtering, or key-value observation, and they contribute to safer, more predictable code.",

By default, all of the code that we write in our apps is executed on the \"main thread\", however, if the main thread ever gets overwhelmed with tasks, it can slow down, freeze, or even crash our app. Luckily, Apple provides us with easy access to many other threads that we can use to offload some of the work!\n\nWe will review how to add different threads, how to perform tasks on a background thread, and how to return back to the main thread afterward. As we get into the second half of this course, we will begin to use background threads more often as we begin to do data intensive tasks, such as downloading data from the internet.",

Map - transform data from one type to another\n\nAs you can imagine, being able to sort, filter, or map data is used ALL the time in production applications.

In reality, hashing is actually MUCH more complex than this, but this is all you really need to understand for our purposes. When we use hash values in SwiftUI applications it's usually to let the system identify which object is which.\n\nHashing is not unique to Swift\/SwiftUI. It is often used in web development and cryptography (yes, in Blockchains and Bitcoin too). If you're interested, there are many articles and YouTube videos that go into detail on how hashing really works. Thankfully, we don't have to get into those details when we implement Apple's Hashable protocol.",

Two of the smartest and safest ways to safely \"unwrap\" these optionals is be using 'if let' and 'guard' statements. In this video we will learn both!

    "intro" : "Regardless of what framework or tool that’s used to build a given UI, finding a good way to separate the structure and internal logic of our various views from the styles that are being applied to them is often key in order to make UI code easier to maintain and manage.\n\nWhile certain technologies offer a quite natural way of separating those two aspects of UI development, such as how websites declare their structure through HTML and their styles using CSS — when it comes to SwiftUI, it might not initially seem like that kind of separation is practical, or even encouraged.\n\nHowever, if we start exploring SwiftUI’s various APIs and conventions a bit further, it turns out that there are a number of tools and techniques that we can use to create a clean separation between our view hierarchy, its styles, and the components that we’re looking to reuse across a given project.\n\nThat’s exactly what we’ll take a look at in this week’s article.",

When we do this, we are telling Xcode that this variable has the potential to be nil (or without a value). Therefore, when we go to use that variable in our code, we need to safely check whether or not it really has a value at that time. Two of the smartest and safest ways to safely \"unwrap\" these optionals is be using 'if let' and 'guard' statements. In this video we will learn both! It should be noted that both of these methods are MUCH safer than explicitly unwrapping optionals by using the ! symbol (avoid this!).",
