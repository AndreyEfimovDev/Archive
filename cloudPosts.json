Currently, the default NavigationView that  comes with the SwiftUI framework is very limited in terms of customization. However, it is very powerful and efficient. In this video, we will learn how to build a custom Navigation View by building custom ViewBuilder wrappers around Apple's default implementation and then adding our custom views on top. This will make a highly performant and reusable example.",

We use @escaping closures to deal with returning from functions when using asynchronous code. This is code that does NOT execute immediately, but rather at a future point in time. This becomes extremely important when we need to download data from the internet!",

As we get into the second half of this course, we will begin to use background threads more often as we begin to do data intensive tasks, such as downloading data from the internet.",

As noted in the title, this video explores how to use the @FetchRequest, which enables us to easily connect Core Data to our SwiftUI View. In the next video, however, we will learn another implementation of Core Data using MVVM architecture - that no longer uses the @FetchRequest. Both implementations are useful and good to know!",

In order to do this, we will learn how to use 3 super-efficient modifiers that Apple provides us with:\n\n1. Sort - organize data by criteria\n2. Filter - create a subset of your data\n3. Map - transform data from one type to another\n\nAs you can imagine, being able to sort, filter, or map data is used ALL the time in production applications. We will learn how to implement these methods and also learn some fancy ways to shorten the code to look like professional developers ;)",

In reality, hashing is actually MUCH more complex than this, but this is all you really need to understand for our purposes. When we use hash values in SwiftUI applications it's usually to let the system identify which object is which.\n\nHashing is not unique to Swift\/SwiftUI. It is often used in web development and cryptography (yes, in Blockchains and Bitcoin too). If you're interested, there are many articles and YouTube videos that go into detail on how hashing really works. Thankfully, we don't have to get into those details when we implement Apple's Hashable protocol.",

When we do this, we are telling Xcode that this variable has the potential to be nil (or without a value). Therefore, when we go to use that variable in our code, we need to safely check whether or not it really has a value at that time. Two of the smartest and safest ways to safely \"unwrap\" these optionals is be using 'if let' and 'guard' statements. In this video we will learn both! It should be noted that both of these methods are MUCH safer than explicitly unwrapping optionals by using the ! symbol (avoid this!).",

    "intro" : "In almost every application there are cases where you will declare variables as optional. In Swift we declare a value as optional be using the ?. When we do this, we are telling Xcode that this variable has the potential to be nil (or without a value). Therefore, when we go to use that variable in our code, we need to safely check whether or not it really has a value at that time. Two of the smartest and safest ways to safely \"unwrap\" these optionals is be using 'if let' and 'guard' statements. In this video we will learn both! It should be noted that both of these methods are MUCH safer than explicitly unwrapping optionals by using the ! symbol (avoid this!).",
